# **Analyzing the Impact of Lifestyle Habits on Academic Performance**

## **Overview**
This project explores how different lifestyle habits—such as study hours, sleep patterns, social media usage, diet quality, and mental health—affect academic performance in students. The analysis is based on a simulated dataset of 1,000 students, sourced from [Kaggle: Student Habits vs Academic Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayaantanaath/student-habits-vs-academic-performance).

## **Key Findings**
- **Correlation of 0.82** between study hours and final exam scores.
- **R² score of 0.89**, indicating that the model explains 89% of the variability in exam scores.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 30.10**, with a **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 5.5**, suggesting high prediction accuracy.

## **Techniques and Tools Used**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Linear Regression** to model the relationship between lifestyle habits and academic performance.
- **Data Visualization** using libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## **Project Goals**
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the impact of student lifestyle habits on academic outcomes, with the potential for applying these findings in educational contexts and enhancing student performance.
